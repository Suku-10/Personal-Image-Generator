# Personal-Image-Generator-using-React
The AI Image Generator is a web application that leverages artificial intelligence to create unique images based on user-provided text prompts. Users can input a description of the image they want to generate, and the application will interact with an underlying AI model to produce the corresponding visual output. The frontend is built with React, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface, and is bundled using Vite for a fast development experience.
